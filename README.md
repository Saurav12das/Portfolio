# Portfolio Website

This repository contains a simple portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. You can use it to showcase your projects, highlight your research, and provide contact information.

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the homepage. The navigation bar links to About, Projects, Research, SOPs, and a dedicated Papers page (`papers.html`). The papers page lists all publications and includes Altmetric badges so you can track online attention for each DOI-linked article.
