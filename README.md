# Portfolio Website

This repository contains a simple portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. You can use it to showcase your projects, highlight your research, and provide contact information.

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site. The navigation bar now includes an additional Research section where you can describe your ongoing projects.
