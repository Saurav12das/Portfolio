# Portfolio Website

This repository contains a simple portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. You can use it to showcase your projects, highlight your research, and provide contact information.

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site. The navigation bar now includes sections for Research and SOPs. Publications are organized in `papers.html`, where entries are grouped by year with keywords and altmetric badges. The “Papers” link in the navigation opens this page.
